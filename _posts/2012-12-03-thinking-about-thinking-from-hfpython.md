今天在下午在公司闲来无事，就开始翻看PC存的 "Head.First.Python" 电子版，到目前为止还没有看到正式讲Python的地方，在正文开始之前此书有很大一部分章节都在讲这本书和你平时看的其他书有什么不同，采用了哪些先进的讲述方式，这书我没看多少也不敢贸然推荐，但是在他这一大段废话中我还是看到了一些令我很满意的东西.
<br> 
在How to use this book Intro中，有这么一个章节，名字就叫 Thinking about thinking 我之所以没有将这一节看作是普通的自我炫耀是因为写的还真的是有些道理的，主要内容就是在讲为什么你有时候看书的时候总看不进去啊，做一些事情要反复多次还是没什么效果，从我们一般人大脑的普遍运作方式的角度去分析了这个问题，并且给出了一些回答，我自己回忆了一下自己平时的一些情况，感觉他们讲的还是很靠谱的。至少我在看的时候是产生了一些共鸣的。

<br> 
下面就是具体内容了。个别地方会加上一些自己的理解。

__Metacognition: thinking about thinking__

<br> 
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.

<br> 
(好吧，我也觉着上边这几句话很装逼，不过表着急，接着看。)

<br> 
Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were __expected__ to learn, but rarely __taught__ to learn.

<br> 
(这倒是实话，更不用说我朝**的教育方式是怎么个样了。)

<br> 
But we assume that if you're holding this book, you really want to learn how to design user-friendly websites. And you probably don't want to spend a lot of  time. If you want to use what you read in this book, you need to remember what you read. And for that, you've got to __understand__ it. To get the most from this book, or any book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on this content. 

<br> 
(这里已经开始提到，要对你的brain负责了)

<br> 
The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you're learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you're in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.

<br> 
(不要再想着以量取胜了，多考虑你brain的感受)

<br> 
So just how DO you get your brain to treat programming like it was a hungry tiger?

<br> 
(让我们一起来分析原因吧)

<br> 
There's the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you are able to learn and remember even the dullest of  topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn't __feel__ important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so I suppose it must be.”

<br> 
(当你死记一些东西的时候有木有想过你的brain是否喜欢他)

<br> 
The faster way is to __do anything that increases brain activity__, especially different types of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of  the solution, and they're all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of  how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.

<br> 
(让你的brain认为这是一件有意思的事情，值得投入精力)

<br> 
A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they're in a conversation, since they're expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn't necessarily care that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if  the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.

<br> 
(让我们和books交互起来，你还在留恋死记硬背的填鸭自习室么?)

<br>

__Here's what WE did:__

<br> 
此书的作者给出了一些建议，我觉着还是挺靠谱的。也许我可以把下面的 we use 改成 you can use.

<br> 
We used __pictures__, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain's concerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.

<br> 
(当然是pictures了，我们的记忆不都是些画面么?)

<br> 
We used redundancy, saying the same thing in __different ways__ and with different media types, and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain. 

<br> 
(多种表达方式会让你的brain感到新鲜)

<br> 
We used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least some __emotional__ content, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of  emotions. That which causes you to feel something is more likely to be remembered, even if  that feeling is nothing more than a little humor, surprise, or interest.

<br> 
(反正我是性情中人)

<br> 
We used a personalized, __conversational__ style, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you're in a conversation than if it thinks you're passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you're reading.

<br> 
(conversation让我们动起来)

<br> 
We include content for __both sides of your brain__, because the more of  your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of  the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of  time. 

<br> 
(别忘了，我们的大脑有两瓣)

<br> 
And we included __stories__ and exercises that present more than one point of view, because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it's forced to make evaluations and judgments. 

<br> 
(有故事有情景)

<br> 
We included __challenges__, with exercises, and by asking __questions__ that don't always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at something. Think about it—you can't get your body in shape just by watching people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you're working hard, it's on the right things. That you're not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.

<br> 
(challenges和questions让我们的brain不会生锈)

__Here's what YOU can do to bend your brain into submission.__

<br> 
(做好准备让brain屈服吧)

<br> 
1.Slow down.The more you understand,the less you have to memorize.

<br> 
Don't just read. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don't just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really is asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of  learning and remembering.

<br> 
(书不是书，是人)

<br> 
2.Do the exercises. Write your own notes.

<br> 
We put them in, but if  we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don't just look at the exercises. Use a pencil. There's plenty of evidence that physical activity while learning can increase the learning. 

<br> 
(做笔记是个好事情，虽然我都没做过，要改正)

<br> 
3.Make this the last thing you read before bed.Or at least the last challenging thing.

<br> 
Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens after you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost. 

<br> 
(这个理论其实还真是第一次听)

<br> 
4.Talk about it. Out loud.

<br> 
Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you're trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You'll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn't known were there when you were reading about it.

<br> 
(这个我在行)

<br> 
5.Drink water. Lots of it.

<br> 
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function. 

<br> 

(这条还真是……)

<br> 
6.Listen to your brain.

<br> 
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it's time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won't learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.

<br> 
(慢慢来)

<br> 
7.Feel something.

<br> 
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is still better than feeling nothing at all.

<br> 
(也许这真的是个好主意)

<br> 
8.Write a lot of code!

<br> 
There's only one way to learn to program: writing a lot of code. And that's what you're going to do throughout this book. Coding is a skill, and the only way to get good at it is to practice. We're going to give you a lot of practice: every chapter has exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don't just skip over them, a lot of the learning happens when you solve the exercises. We included a solution to each exercise, don't be afraid to peek at the solution if you get stuck! (It's easy to get snagged on something small.) But try to solve the problem before you look at the solution. And definitely get it working before you move on to the next part of the book.

<br> 
(从小就不爱做习题咋弄)

看着这儿相信大家会有些想法的，不过是程度的问题。

<br> 
其实这些东西我们在高中的时候就有很多的提法，各种学习指导报和学校强制要求订阅的刊，多年以后在看到这些东西反而更有感觉了，当时坐在课堂里的我究竟把注意力放在哪儿了呢？

<br> 
Who Tm Konws!先等到5点去跑步吧！
